# aprofili
Repository for code from Adam Profili's work during the Summer 2021 REU program

Only file that is up to date is Long Chain Simulation.ipynb or .py
This contains a simulation model that is fairly moldable to anything N-System or Long Chain. The inputs are found in Section 2: Input Parameters
Explanations for all inputs are given. There is no GUI yet, so inputs can simply be changed in the file before running.

Current outputs supported are .csv tables with queue length information, graphs of queue lengths over time,
2-dimensional joint distribution plots, and n-dimensional marginal distribution plots.
